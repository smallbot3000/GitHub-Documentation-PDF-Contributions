\section{About Screenshots in GitHub Documentation}\label{sec:abt_ss_docu}
You can help users locate elements of the user interface that are difficult to find by adding screenshots to GitHub
documentation.
There are positives and negatives to adding a screenshot.
Screenshots make articles more visually scannable and make instructions easier to understand, especially for people
who have difficulty reading.
When supplied with alt text, screenshots help blind and low-vision users collaborate with sighted colleagues.

On the other hand, screenshots privilege sighted users, add length and load time to articles, and increase the
volume of content that needs to be maintained.
When captured at different pixel dimensions and degrees of zoom than the reader is using, screenshots can be confusing.
Therefore, we only add screenshots to GitHub Docs when they meet our criteria for inclusion.

\section{Criteria for Including a Screenshot}\label{sec:ss_inc_crit}
Use a screenshot to complement text instructions when an element of the user interface (UI) is hard to find, such as
in the following cases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The element is small or visually subtle: For example, Figure~\ref{fig:ss_yes_ui_small} displays an image
    of an instance where The edit button for a repository's social media preview image is small and visually
    unobtrusive.
    It may be hard to find among the other repository settings.
    \item The element is not immediately visible.
    For example, the element is contained in a drop-down menu.
    This can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_yes_hidden_ui}, where the options to clone a gist are contained under a
    dropdown menu labeled \enquote{Embed.}

    \item The interface has multiple competing choices that can cause confusion.
    As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_multi_choice}, There are three elements that could be interpreted as \enquote{settings}  on the main page for a
    repository: the \enquote{Settings}  tab, the gear icon in the \enquote{About}  section of the right sidebar, and the account
    settings accessed via the profile picture.
\end{enumerate}

%Do not use screenshots for procedural steps where text alone is clear, or to show code commands or outputs.
% do we want this? idk if it would be helpful?

\section{Violations of Screenshot Inclusion Criteria}\label{sec:ss_no_follow_crit}
The following screenshots do not meet our criteria for inclusion, as seen in the list below.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The UI element is easy to find: The \enquote{Create repository}  button is visually prominent through size, color,
    and placement.
    There are few competing choices.
    This is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_no_ui_easy}, where Text instructions are adequate to help the user complete
    the step.
    \item The UI has few, straightforward choices: It is simple and straightforward options, such as selecting or
    deselecting a checkbox, do not need a visual support.
    As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ui_no_strfwd_choice}, Text instructions are adequate to help the user complete the step.
    However, There are also two accessibility implications of including the full sentence of text below the checkbox in
    the screenshot, as listed below:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The sentence is hard to read for low-sighted users, because it's small and not as crisp as HTML text.
        \item A person using a screen reader won't have access to the information, because it will not fit within
        alt text character limits.
        Including the text in the instructions would remedy this, but would be unnecessarily wordy.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
