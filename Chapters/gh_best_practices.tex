\section{Best Practices for Writing GitHub Documentation}\label{sec:best_prac}
Whether you're creating a new article or updating an existing one, you should follow these guidelines given in the
Sub-Section below.
\subsection{Align Content to User Needs}\label{subsec:align_user}
Before you begin, it’s important to understand who you’re writing for, what their goals are, the core tasks or
concepts that the article will address, and what type of content to write.

In terms of defining the audience, the author must consider who will be reading the article, and what the reader is
trying to do with the information.

When defining the core purpose of the article, the author must answer a small number of questions.
Firstly, what should someone be able to do or understand after reading this article?
Choose one or two tasks or concepts that the content will discuss.
In addition, if there are additional tasks, concepts, or information that are not essential, consider if they can be
placed lower in the article, moved to another article, or omitted completely.

After defining the audience and cor purpose of the article, the author must also determine the type of content that
is presented in the article that they are writing.
These are given in the list below.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conceptual Content: Conceptual content helps people understand a feature or topic by providing a clear,
    high-level overview, explanation of how the feature or topic can help them on their journey, and context like
    use cases or examples.
    \item Referral Content: Referral Content is content that provides detailed information that people need while they
    are actively using a feature.
    Some major subjects may require their own referential article, especially if there
    is a large amount of referential content, such as for search syntax or YAML syntax in GitHub Actions.
    For smaller amounts of content or more specific information, like a list of a feature’s supported languages or
    hardware requirements, use referential sections in context within procedural or conceptual articles.
    \item Procedural Content: Procedural content gives context on how a task fits into someone's larger goal.
     This content helps people complete a task from start to finish while they are using GitHub.
     This content is also written as sections within larger articles.
    \item Troubleshooting Content: Troubleshooting content includes built-in errors we expect people to encounter,
    common problems reported to support, and situations people might encounter while completing tasks.
    Use troubleshooting sections in guides or procedural articles to keep solutions close to procedures.
    Work with support and product managers to surface common errors and include them in the documentation.
    \item Quickstart Content: Quickstarts enable people to quickly complete a discrete, focused task by illustrating
    a workflow with only essential steps, in about five minutes or 600 words.
    Quickstarts can be used for quickly getting set up with a new tool, or for quickly completing another task.
    For more complex tasks, use a tutorial.
    \item Tutorial Content: Tutorials are useful when someone has a basic understanding of the product and is
    interested in extending their understanding to solve a specific problem
\end{enumerate}

\section{Structure Content for Readability}\label{sec:struct_read}
Use the following best practices to structure the content.
When adding content to an existing article, follow the existing structure whenever possible.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide initial context.
    Define the topic and state its relevance to the reader.
    \item Structure the content in a logical order by importance and relevance.
    Place information in order of
    priority, and in the order users will need it.
    \item Avoid long sentences and paragraphs.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Introduce concepts one by one.
        \item Use one idea per paragraph.
        \item Use one idea per sentence.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Emphasize the most important information.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Begin each sentence or paragraph with the most important words and takeaways.
        \item When explaining a concept, start with the conclusion, then explain it in more detail.
        (This is sometimes called an \enquote{inverted pyramid.})
        \item When explaining a complex topic, present readers with the basic information first, and disclose the
        details later in the article.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use meaningful subheadings.
    Organize related paragraphs into sections.
    Give each section a subheading that is unique and that accurately describes the content.
    \item Consider using in-page links for longer content.
    This allows readers to jump to areas of interest and skip
    content that is irrelevant to them.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Write for Readability}\label{sec:readability}

The author must make it easy for busy users to read and understand the text.
To do so, follow the best practices below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use plain language.
    Use common, everyday words, and avoid jargon when possible.
    Terms that are well known to
    developers are fine, but don't assume that the reader knows the details of how GitHub works.
    \item Use active voice.
    \item Be concise.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Write sentences that are simple and brief.
        \item Avoid complex sentences that contain multiple concepts.
        \item Pare down unnecessary details.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Format for Scalability}\label{sec:scanability}

Most readers don't consume articles in their entirety.
Instead, they either \textit{scan} the page to locate specific
information, or \textit{skim} the page to get a general idea of the concepts.

When scanning or skimming content, readers skip over large chunks of text.
They look for elements that are related to their task or that stand out on the page, such as headings, alerts,
lists, tables, code blocks, visuals, and the first few words in each section.

Once the article has a clearly defined purpose and structure, you can apply the following formatting techniques to
optimize the content for scanning and skimming.
These techniques can also help to make content more understandable for all readers.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use text highlighting such as boldface and hyperlinks to call attention to the most important points.
    Use text highlighting sparingly.
    Do not highlight more than $10\%$ of the total text in an article.
    \item Use formatting elements to separate the content and create space on the page.
    For example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bulleted and numbered lists (with optional run-in subheads)
        \item Numbered lists
        \item \href{https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/style-guide-and-content-model/style-guide#alerts}{Alerts}
        \item Tables
        \item Visuals
        \item Code blocks and code annotations
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
